## Overview

This repository collects essential Computer Science topics that form the foundational building blocks for any aspiring software engineer. By starting with how hardware is organized and progressing through system software, data management, and application‑level concepts, you’ll gain a clear, connected understanding of how modern technology works—and why. Mastery of these subjects is also crucial for technical interviews at top companies (MNCs, FAANG/MAANG) and a must on your path to becoming a skilled engineer.

## Core Subjects

1. **Computer Organization & Architecture**  
   Learn how CPUs execute instructions, how memory hierarchies and buses work, and what happens “under the hood” when your code runs.

2. **Operating Systems**  
   Explore process and thread management, virtual memory, scheduling, and I/O—everything that an OS does to keep applications running smoothly and safely.

3. **Database Management Systems**  
   Understand relational models, query processing, indexing, transactions, and how data is stored, retrieved, and maintained.

4. **Computer Networks**  
   Dive into network layers, protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP), routing, and security principles that enable devices to communicate across the globe.

5. **Object‑Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
   Master classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and design patterns to write modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

6. **Software Engineering**  
   Study software development life cycles, requirements gathering, design methodologies, testing strategies, and version control best practices.

7. **Artificial Intelligence**  
   Gain an introduction to search algorithms, knowledge representation, machine learning fundamentals, and common AI applications.
